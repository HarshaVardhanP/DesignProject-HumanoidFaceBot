# Humanoid Face Bot

Gesture recognition is an approach for an efficient human computer interaction. We chose facial gesture recognition as our approach to make the interaction possible. The goal of the project is to develop a humanoid face bot which can mimic the facial gestures of the user in real time. Two common face gestures i.e., Eye Blink and Jaw Movement are picked to implement in this prototype. In this project,  facial gesture recognition is done using OpenCV and Arduino is used in hardware to implement the gestures recognized on prototype. Now, Humanoid Face Bot is capable of mimicking eye-blink and jaw movement in real time.

Please go through the report FGR_EE304_Final_Project.pdf for details about the project.
